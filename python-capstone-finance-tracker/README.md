The personal finance tracker lets you add your expenses, view all expenses, view expense summary, and clear all expenses.
Expenses are saved as a dictionary in the following format:
"Category": [("Description1", Amount1), ("Description2", Amount2)]

Expenses are saved to the data.pkl file, allowing you to save and access data previously entered.

To run the tracker, simply navigate to the folder with the finance_tracker.py file and run the following command in terminal:
python finance_tracker.py
OR
python3 finance_tracker.py

Upon running the tracker, you will be prompted with a menu. Please choose that option you wish to use.
